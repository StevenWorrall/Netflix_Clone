# Netflix Clone

#### Currently in Development so some features are still buggy or not cleaned up yet.

I really like the look and feel of the Netflix app so I decided to recreate the UI elements and their behaviour. This project focuses on practicing animations, MVC structure, and complex/nested UI structures. Alongside this, all og those complex structures are to be minipulated with cool animations that Netflix does within their app.

Here is an exmaple of the app in it's infancy. I'm still perfecting the look and functionality of everything.
