# Netflix Clone

#### Currently in Development so some features are still buggy or not cleaned up yet.

I really liked the look and feel of the Netflix app so I decided to recreate the UI elements and their behaviour. This project focuses on practicing animations, MVC structure, and complex/nested UI structures. Alongside this, all og those complex structures are to be minipulated with cool animations that Netflix does within their app.
